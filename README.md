# KNN
KNN classifier on MNIST data
My batchmate and I implemented KNN using two ways on a MNIST data. We used our roll numbers to specify our k and n value.
The two ways that we implemented the classifier is - 1) using library functions and 2) from scratch.
Then we generated confusion matrix for each iteration of cross validation and generated an average of the confusion matrices.
This was just to get a general idea of what basically is KNN classifier.
